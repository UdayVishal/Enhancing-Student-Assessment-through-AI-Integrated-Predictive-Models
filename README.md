# Enhancing-Student-Assessment-through-AI-Integrated-Predictive-Models

The integration of deep learning and traditional
machine learning algorithms has ushered in a new era of student
assessment and performance enhancement in education. Through
their application, these algorithms analyze extensive student data
to uncover patterns and trends, ultimately predicting studentsâ€™
grades. Moreover, they extend beyond assessment, providing valuable insights to support students in their learning journeys and
facilitate continuous improvement in their performance. Early
identification of students at risk of academic setbacks enables
tailored interventions, fostering a culture of academic excellence.
By examining the diverse benefits and practical applications of
deep learning and traditional machine learning algorithms in education. This project leverages both deep learning and traditional
machine learning algorithms to assess student performance. The
project introduces a novelty by employing Bi-Directional LSTM
for student assessment
